                    I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought
                    that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
                    any of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-text">
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that
                    I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
                    relationship.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-text"></p>
                <h3 class="hero-subtitile">How I turned things around</h3>
                <p class="hero-text">
                    I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                    everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the
                    garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment,
                    and I quit my job.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-text">
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such
                    a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                </p>
                <h3 class="hero-subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p class="hero-text">
                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much
                    better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I
                    have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p class="hero-text">
                    With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no
                    choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can
                    benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
                    started this site!
